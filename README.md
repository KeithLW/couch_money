# Couch Money

A toy project made for the YouTube video found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1eLu-HL-fc

The purpose of this program is to allow you to keep track of your miscellaneous gift cards, balances, etc. found on various websites and aggregate them all into one place. 

The present program is more or less only a proof of concept, but I encourage others to fork this project and add in functionality for websites that they have gift cards, balances, etc. for practice.
